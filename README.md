# Homebridge Broadlink RM [TV+AC Pro Fork]

## Version 4.3.1+ notes
There are a couple of changes made in version 4.3.1 which might cause issues when you upgrade.
1. There was a bug in how MAC addresses were stored in the plugin. If you specify a HOST in your config.json by MAC address, you'll likely need to correct this value after you update.
2. In order to fix an issue in iOS 14, all TVs are now seperate accessories. Previously the first TV connected via Homebridge as a bridge. This means that after updating, that first TV will need to be removed and re-added to HomeKit.
3. The Dehumidifer accessory has been updated to use the Humidity readings from your Broadlink device. If your Broadlink device doesn't support Humidity readings, or you don't want to functionality set `"noHumidity" : true` in your config.json

For other changes, refer to the Change Log [here](https://github.com/kiwi-cam/homebridge-broadlink-rm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Documentation

If the plugin is unable to discover your device, it's likely you've registered the device with the cloud so it no longer accepts local connections. In this case, follow these steps:
1. Hold the reset button on your broadlink device until the light flashes
2. In the IHC app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/intelligent-home-center/id1084990073) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.com.broadlink.econtrol.plus&hl=en)) Go through the "Add Device" steps
3. When you reach the step to add the device to a room - quit the IHC app

This plugin should now be able to discover your device.

Base documentation can be found [here](https://lprhodes.github.io/slate/). With the following additional configuration options available in this fork:

### Switch Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
pingGrace (optional) | Pauses ping status changes for the specified period (seconds) to allow device to start-up/shutdown after the change | 15 | 10

### Aircon Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
w1DeviceID (optional) | Updates device current temperature from a Raspberry Pi Wire-1 thermometers (i.e. ds18b20). Value is the Device ID | 28-0321544e531ff | 
heatOnly (optional) | Forces the Aircon accessory to only operate in Heat mode | true | false
coolOnly (optional) | Forces the Aircon accessory to only operate in Cool mode | true | false
noHumidity (optional) | Removes Humidity information from the device. It will be removed when using w1Device or temperatureFilePath | true | false

#### "data" key-value object
The device can be setup to manage modes in one of two ways. If your AC unit accepts a hexcade to change mode only (without temperature details) you can set the mode keys (heat/cool) and then the temperatureX values to change the teperature. If your AC unit sends hexcodes that contain the mode AND temperature you can use the modeX codes alone.

When the mode is changed the mode hexcodes are sent first - if set. Then the modeX code is sent to set the temperature, if it is set. If a matching modeX code can't be found, the temperatureX code is sent.  If neither of these temperature codes are found either defaultHeatTemperature or defaultCoolTemperature codes will be used depending on if the target Temperature is higher or lower than the current temperature.

key | description
--- | -----------
off | A hex code string to be sent when the air conditioner is asked to be turned off.
temperatureX | A hex code string where X is any temperature you wish to support e.g. "temperature30".
modeX | A hex code string where X is any temperture, and mode is one of "heat","cool", or "auto". Hex code used to set unit to the specified mode and temperature

#### "temperatureX" and "modeX" key-value object

key | description
--- | -----------
data | Hex data stored as string.
pseudo-mode (optional) | The mode we set when this hex is sent. i.e. "heat" or "cool". For graphical purposes only (hence use of the term "pseudo"). Not recommended for ModeX key-values.

### TemperatureSensor Accessory
