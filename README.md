# Homebridge Broadlink RM [TV+AC Pro Fork]

## Version 4.3.1+ notes
There are a couple of changes made in version 4.3.1 which might cause issues when you upgrade.
1. There was a bug in how MAC addresses were stored in the plugin. If you specify a HOST in your config.json by MAC address, you'll likely need to correct this value after you update.
2. In order to fix an issue in iOS 14, all TVs are now seperate accessories. Previously the first TV connected via Homebridge as a bridge. This means that after updating, that first TV will need to be removed and re-added to HomeKit.
3. The Dehumidifer accessory has been updated to use the Humidity readings from your Broadlink device. If your Broadlink device doesn't support Humidity readings, or you don't want to functionality set `"noHumidity" : true` in your config.json

For other changes, refer to the Change Log [here](https://github.com/kiwi-cam/homebridge-broadlink-rm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Documentation

If the plugin is unable to discover your device, it's likely you've locked the device with the cloud so it no longer accepts local connections. In this case, follow these steps:
1. Open the [Broadlink app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/broadlink/id1450257910)
2. From the Home screen, tap on your Broadlink device
3. Tap the ... in the top right
4. Scroll down and toggle "Lock device" to Off
5. Tap OK when prompted "Confirm to unlock the device"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DMTUbDo.png" width="40%" height="40%">

This plugin should now be able to discover your device.

Base documentation can be found [here](https://lprhodes.github.io/slate/). With the following additional configuration options available in this fork:

### Hosts Configuration
By default the plugin will search the network and discover your Broadlink devices. If you'd prefer to manaually add devices you can add a hosts section to your config.json (refer to the [sample config](https://github.com/kiwi-cam/homebridge-broadlink-rm/blob/master/config-sample.json#L18-L27))
key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
isRFSupported (optional) | Forces the device to support RF signals | true | false
isRM4 (optional) | Marks the device as a newer RM4 device and sends data with required new headers | true | false

### Switch Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
pingGrace (optional) | Pauses ping status changes for the specified period (seconds) to allow device to start-up/shutdown after the change | 15 | 10

### Fan Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
hideSwingMode (optional) | Determines whether we should hide the swing mode UI or not. If true, also changes the accessory type to allow additional Fan icons. | true | false
alwaysResetToDefaults (optional) | If set, the fanSpeed is reset to its default when the fan is turned off. | true | false
defaultFanSpeed (optional) | Sets the default Speed for the fan when a value isn't already set. | 50 | 100
stepSize (optional) | If set, sets the amount the fanSpeed will step up/down by | 10 | 1

### Aircon Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
w1DeviceID (optional) | Updates device current temperature from a Raspberry Pi Wire-1 thermometers (i.e. ds18b20). Value is the Device ID | 28-0321544e531ff | 
heatOnly (optional) | Forces the Aircon accessory to only operate in Heat mode | true | false
coolOnly (optional) | Forces the Aircon accessory to only operate in Cool mode | true | false
noHumidity (optional) | Removes Humidity information from the device. It will be removed when using w1Device or temperatureFilePath | true | false

#### "data" key-value object
The device can be setup to manage modes in one of two ways. If your AC unit accepts a hexcade to change mode only (without temperature details) you can set the mode keys (heat/cool) and then the temperatureX values to change the teperature. If your AC unit sends hexcodes that contain the mode AND temperature you can use the modeX codes alone.

When the mode is changed the mode hexcodes are sent first - if set. Then the modeX code is sent to set the temperature, if it is set. If a matching modeX code can't be found, the temperatureX code is sent.  If neither of these temperature codes are found either defaultHeatTemperature or defaultCoolTemperature codes will be used depending on if the target Temperature is higher or lower than the current temperature.

key | description
--- | -----------
off | A hex code string to be sent when the air conditioner is asked to be turned off.
temperatureX | A hex code string where X is any temperature you wish to support e.g. "temperature30".
modeX | A hex code string where X is any temperture, and mode is one of "heat","cool", or "auto". Hex code used to set unit to the specified mode and temperature

#### "temperatureX" and "modeX" key-value object
