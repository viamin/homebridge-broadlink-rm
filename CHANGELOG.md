 - [Improvement] Set node-persist to ignore parse errors to stop crashing the plugin on read errors

 - [Improvement] Added MQTT support to AC and Temperature sensor using temperature,humidity, and battery identifiers
 - [Improvement] Added HeaterCooler accessory option. Refer to [this document](https://github.com/kiwi-cam/homebridge-broadlink-rm/blob/kiwi-cam-beta-1/docs/heater-cooler.md) to read @newt10's work here.
