## [Unreleased]
### Changed
 - Improved default allowResend logic when using preventResendHex
### Fixed
 - Fixed characteristic 'Current Temperature': characteristic was supplied illegal value when a heater-cooler reads below 10
 - Fixed name not defined error when using oscillate in Heater Cooler

## [4.4.4] - 2021-06-09
### Added
- Heater-Cooler states now all support allowResend for when values are not changing.
- Heater-Cooler now supports humidity values and noHumidity configuration.

- The Platform now also supports logLevel configuration
- Learn RF now finds 0xb2 codes
### Changed

- turnOnWhenOff now defaults to true for Heater-Cooler accessories.
- All accessories now explicitly have allowResend set to true by default.
- Learn Accessories will temporarily enable platform level debug during a learn
### Fixed
- Learn RF now times out after 60 seconds to allow all frequencies to be scanned. 

## [4.4.3] - 2021-05-04
### Added
 - Adds Mute button to TV accessories (No HomeKit support and untested yet)
 - Adds the RM Mini 3 6507
 - Adds fan speed step functionality and speed improvements (Thanks @EpicKris)
 - Adds Current Temperature support to Heater-Cooler accessories. Offers all the same options: file, MQTT, or RM Pro Device (Thanks @uzumaki20398)
 - Allows HEX Objects for additional charactistics on Fan, Air-Purifier, and HumidifierDehumidifier Accessories (Thanks @ aymericbaur)
 - Adds turnOnWhenOff support to the HeaterCooler Accessory
### Fixed
 - Fixes bug with Parsing JSON MQTT messages (#298)
 - Fixes fanv1 "counterClockwise is undefined" error when showRotationDirection is true (#306)

## [4.4.2] - 2021-04-07
### Added
 - Adds offDryMode configuration option to the airconditioner accessory. Thanks @pixeleyesltd
 - Adds stateless configuration switch option to have a switch "forget" its state
 - Adds Eve History service support. This can be disabled by adding `"noHistory":true` to your config
### Changed
 - Set node-persist to ignore parse errors to stop crashing the plugin on read errors
 - Sets "undefined" characteristics to either 0 or minValue to prevent future Homebridge errors
 - Moves onTemperature and onHumidity logging to Debug only, reducing noice in the logs from all updates
### Fixed
 - Fixes mac address formatting error when using manual hosts devices #266
 - Fixes Accessory mac address formatting to support all formats the hosts section does - and improve matching to devices.
 - Stopped MQTT updates from defaulting to 0 when the topic isn't found. This does create messages that the plugin is slowing homebridge until MQTT updates are recieved.

## [4.4.1] - 2021-01-27
### Added
 -  Adds pingUseArp configuration to use an ARP lookup instead of ICMP ping to test a device's status

### Fixed
 -  Fixes "'Temperature Display Units': characteristic was supplied illegal value: undefined!"
 -  Fixes "SET handler returned write response value, though the characteristic doesn't support write response! when returning a value"
 -  Fixes Learn Button error "the characteristic 'On': characteristic was supplied illegal value: undefined!"
 -  Fixes Error in Heater-Cooler with setting a value to a constant

## [4.4.0] - 2020-12-17
### Added
 -  Added Low Battery Alerts to Humidity and Temperature sensors (using battery:XX in readings from files)
 -  Extended Temperature and Humidity readings from files to support temperature:XX, humidity:XX, and battery:XX values on each line
 -  Added MQTT support to AC and Temperature sensor using temperature,humidity, and battery identifiers
 -  Added HeaterCooler accessory option. Refer to [this document](https://github.com/kiwi-cam/homebridge-broadlink-rm/blob/kiwi-cam-beta-1/docs/heater-cooler.md) to read @newt10's work here.
### Changed
 -  Updated all dependencies to remove some security vulnerabilities 
 -  Removed file and w1 Temperature readings being forced to 10 minutes. Now 1 minute minimum and adjustable
 -  Integrated the platform helper module to improve maintainability.
 -  MQTT will update when published so frequent refreshes aren't required ( 10 minute default as a fallback )
### Fixed
 -  Fixed duplicate monitorTemperature calls from Temperature Sensor accessories
 -  Fixed SIGTERM when unexpected packet received

## [4.3.8] - 2020-12-01
### Added
-  **Added RF Learning** steps from #45
### Changed
-  Added Keep Alive packet to RM Devices to avoid reboots when the cloud is unreachable.
### Fixed
-  Fixes "No Response" from Dehumidifers when noHumidity and accessory Off
-  Fixes "log is not a function" error when using Pronto codes

## [4.3.7] - 2020-11-16
### Fixed
-  Fixes missing FanSpeed/Direction features in Fanv1

## [4.3.6] - 2020-11-11
### Added
-  Adds humidityFilePath support to the HumidifierDehumidifier accessory to update the current humidity from a local file
-  Adds autoOn/autoOff support to the Fan and HumidifierDehumidifier accessory (Note the Bug detail below)
### Changed
-  Improves HumidifierDehumidifier accessory to update state by using Humidity data from the Broadlink device 
-  Updated humiditySensor and temperatureSensor accessories to extend HumidifierDehumidifier and AirCon accessories (respectively) so both gain MQTT and file values too.
-  Updated the switch accessory to use On/Active status depending on device type. Many accessories inherit from this and it broke their AutoOff functions.
### Fixed
-  Fixed AutoOn/AutoOff functions for Fan and HumidifierDehumidifier. This was an issue with the different characteristics between the HomeKit Fan and Fanv2 Services. In order to tidy this up users wanting to have the classic style Fan (with more icon options) will need to update type to "fanv1" i.e. `"type": "fanv1"`

## [4.3.5] - -2020-11-02
-  Fixes bug in Fan accessory that removed Rotation Direction and/or Swing options

## [4.3.4] - 2020-10-27

### Fixed
-  Fixes Air Purifier so it no longer appears as a fan
-  Removes limits on air-conditioner Current Temperature so it isn't constrained to the same limits as the Target Temperature.
-  Fixed the identification of manual devices. New Manual deviceTypes added which are selected based on isRFSupported and isRM4. isRM4 will be required on newer devices to make sure messages include the correct headers.
-  Fixes an error in the aircon accessory where HEX codes for temperatureXX would falsely report as missing

## [4.3.3] - 2020-09-29
### Added

### Fixed
-  Fixes issue in heatOnly mode for Aircon accessories
